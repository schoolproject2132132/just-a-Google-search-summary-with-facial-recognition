# Voice Assistant with Speech Recognition, Face Recognition, and Internet Search

This project is a Python-based voice assistant that integrates **Speech Recognition**, **Face Recognition**, and **Internet Search**. It listens to your voice commands, recognizes your face (if present), and responds using text-to-speech. If the user requests information via voice, the assistant can search the web and speak the results back to you.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken commands into text using the Google Speech-to-Text API.
- **Face Recognition**: Detects and recognizes faces using the `face_recognition` library. It greets the user accordingly based on facial recognition.
- **Internet Search**: The assistant can perform searches using the Google Custom Search API and speak the results aloud.
- **Text-to-Speech**: The assistant speaks back responses using the `pyttsx3` library.

## Requirements

Before running the program, make sure to install the necessary libraries:

### Python Libraries

- `SpeechRecognition`: For speech-to-text conversion.
- `pyttsx3`: For text-to-speech functionality.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the Google Custom Search API.
- `opencv-python`: For capturing video feed for face recognition.
- `face_recognition`: For detecting and recognizing faces.

### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, you can install the required libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 requests opencv-python face_recognition
   ```

2. **Set Up Google Custom Search**

   To enable the internet search functionality, you need to:

   - Create a Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) from [Google Custom Search](https://cse.google.com/cse/).
   - Enable the **Custom Search API** and get your **API Key** from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Copy your **API Key** and **Custom Search Engine ID (cx)** and insert them in the script under the `search_on_internet` function.

   Example:
   ```python
   api_key = "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
   cx = "YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**

   Run the script in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python assistant.py
   ```

2. **Provide Input**

   - The assistant will listen for a voice command. 
   - After processing the speech, it will recognize the face (if present) and greet the user.
   - If you say something like "search [query]", the assistant will search the web using Google Custom Search and speak the result.

3. **Stop the Script**

   To stop the script, simply press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## Example Interaction

1. **Input**: The user says "search Python programming tutorials."
2. **Assistant**: The assistant will respond with a greeting and say something like, "Here is what I found: Python Programming Tutorials. You can read more at [link]."

## How It Works

### Speech Recognition

- The assistant listens for a command using the microphone.
- The `speech_recognition` library converts the spoken command into text using the Google Web Speech API.
  
### Face Recognition

- The assistant uses the `face_recognition` library and OpenCV to capture the webcam video.
- It detects faces in the video feed. If a face is detected, it prints "Face recognized!" and greets the user accordingly.

### Internet Search

- The assistant can search the web for user queries using Google Custom Search.
- It fetches the search results and speaks the title and link of the top result.

### Text-to-Speech

- Once the assistant has a response (from either speech recognition, a search, or a face recognition greeting), it uses the `pyttsx3` library to speak the response.

## Troubleshooting

- **Speech Recognition**: If the assistant cannot understand your command, make sure you're speaking clearly and there's minimal background noise.
- **Face Recognition**: Ensure that your webcam is properly working and the face is clearly visible to the camera.
- **Google Search API**: Google imposes a daily limit on API usage, so you might hit a quota limit if you make too many requests in one day.

## Limitations

- **Limited Face Recognition**: This implementation only recognizes a generic "John Doe" face. To improve this, you can train the system to recognize multiple known faces by using a dataset of labeled images.
- **Search API Limitations**: The Google Custom Search API has a daily free usage limit. Ensure you manage search queries wisely to avoid exceeding the quota.
